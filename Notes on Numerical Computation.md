**Two types of Numerical errors**
1) Underflow - occurs when numbers close to zero are rounded off as zero.
2) Overflow - occurs when numbers with large magnitude are approximated as -&infin; or &infin;.

** Poor Conditioning **
Condition Number - ratio of the magintude of the largest and smallest eigenvalue.
